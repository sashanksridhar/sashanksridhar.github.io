- Worked for Rates Risk at FXLM.
- Created End of Day notifications for batches to include if it is a holiday or not at each batch and published the notifications using Apache Kafka. Helped in determining if there are a lack of trades or if the batch has a holiday.
- Developed a Spring microservice to identify trades with high differences in feeds and thereby helped eliminate the number of errors as well as missing books. Used Apache POI to highlight the levels of differences and used SMTP to send mails with summary of the reports.
- Improved accessibility of trades by introducing composite keys that represented unique books and trades.
- Created new batches of trades in two PROD environments which introduced an abstraction between regions.
- Created a RabbitMQ pipeline to communicate between different services and analysed the effect of priority and prefetch on the consumer side.
