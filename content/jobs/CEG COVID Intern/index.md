- Study of COVID-19 Chest Xray Similarity using CNN

- Analysed the correlation between COVID-19 and 11 other lung diseases in order to determine their onset by building individual ResNet models to learn the features of each disease.

- Calculated the relative similarity between the gradient class activation maps of various lung diseases determined using each diseaseâ€™s corresponding ResNet model.
