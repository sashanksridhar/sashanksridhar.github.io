Iâ€™m currently a MS (Research, Computer Science) student at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), supervised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/) at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/)

Previously, I was working as a Software Developer at Citicorp Services India Pvt. Ltd. for their **Foreign Exchange and Local Markets (FXLM)** and **Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS)** Businesses.

I love working on research problems and have published over [35 papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v97f514AAAAJ&hl=en/) in the fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Software Defined Networks and Blockchain. When I am not working on something, you can find me playing FIFA or just chilling with a cup of coffee!
